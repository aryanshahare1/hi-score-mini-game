Description: Developed a Python-based command-line game where the player competes to achieve a high score. The game randomly generates a score for the player, and the program reads from a hiscore.txt file, which either contains the previous high score or is blank. If the player's score exceeds the current high score, the file is updated with the new score. This project demonstrates essential Python skills, including file handling, conditional logic, and randomization using the random module. The code is organized to ensure clarity and efficiency, showcasing my ability to build interactive and user-friendly Python applications. 
What I Learned: Understanding the basics of file I/O operations in python, enhancing problem-solving skills through project-based learning.
